            The Matched Interaction Across Tissues (MIxT) is a system designed
            for exploring and comparing transcriptional profiles from two or
            more matched tissues across individuals.  Here, the MIxT system is
            applied to tumor and blood transcriptional profiles from breast
            cancer patients from the Norwegian Women and Cancer study.

                In a network, genes can be represented by nodes colored by their module membership.
                A pair of nodes is connected with an edge if there is a significant co-expresson 
                relationship between them (topological overlap > 0.1). In both tissues, the edges that 
                span between modules reflect natural overlaps between cellular processes enriched in modules.

               To explore the system-level changes across tumor and the systemic
               response of patients, we constructed tight coexpression gene sets 
               (also called modules) in tumor and blood tissue, respectively. MIxT
               enables the exploration of module content, expression profiles,
               and functional enrichment. Visualizes how module expression
               orders patients to identify clinicopathological variables
               associated with each module.  Allows to explore blood module
               expression in breast cancer patients compared to healthy
               controls.

               Displays significance of gene overlap between modules across
               tissues as such an overlap may suggest a very simple “mirrored”
               type of co-expression patterns.  Visualizes expression of genes
               in common between modules across tissues.  Displays significance
               of interactions between modules defined by the correlation
               between patient orderings induced by modules. Allows selection of
               a particular subtype. Visualizes expression of genes in modules
               interacting between tissues across all patients or within a
               subtype of interest.
